Terminal Dash is a Geometry Dash recreation that runs in your terminal and is written in C++.

I made it back in 2022, and it's just kinda been sitting there and doing nothing. This will serve as a public archive to look at my terrible code.

The game was only designed to run on Windows. Sorry, my Linux friends. (you can use wine tho)

## Features

- Runs in your terminal
- Sounds
- Level editor

## Requirements

- Windows (Windows 10 or higher recommended)
- Visual C++
